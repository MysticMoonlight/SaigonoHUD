**SaigonoHUD 1.0.0-dev**

# What is SaigonoHUD?
Saigo no Chi(lit. Final Blood), or simply SaigonoHUD(最期のHUD) is a yet another stylish and ambitious HUD project for Team Fortress 2, forked from ZeesHUD-UnDonered. It is intended to remove any reference to Zeesastrous and ZeesHUD and keeping the HUD Up-to-date for latest TF2, due to following criticism towards the author of the HUD.

# What changes have been made?
- Donor box has been removed, with black screen warnings
- Most elements related to Zeesastrous/ZeesHUD are completely removed
- New logo and single background, as well as small changes to main menu
- This project will remain non-profit, so any unrelated link will be removed except existing TF2 things
- New main color and fonts inspired from several japanese mangas (Actually HUD style was inspired from Shibuya Sukeban made by Plank)

# Note
The fork status and previous contributions from GitHub will be remained, to prevent any further issues related to this project.

We only upload this project to GitHub, not from GameBanana and HUDS.TF. So please do note that we cannot provide support for HUD you downloaded outside of GitHub.
